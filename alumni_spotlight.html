                    <h4>Michael Cirelli</h4>


                    <p>No one can capture my time in APO better than Vin Diesel in Fast and Furious 7: “I don’t have
                        friends… I
                        got
                        family.” I learned so much from people of all majors and favorite CTB orders about how to work
                        effectively with others in meaningful service; and though we rarely drive cars off skyscrapers
                        or yeet
                        giant safes through the streets of Rio together, I’m still close with my Cult lineage, Jenkins
                        Clan, and
                        APO brothers.Being scattered across the country means you’ll always have family wherever you go!
                        In the
                        meantime, I’m currently baking, reading, running, working out, and striving to achieve red
                        member status
                        at Chick-Fil-A. Besides that, I’m spending my gap years before medical school as a clinical
                        research
                        coordinator in thoracic surgery; my main research project involves testing a handheld device’s
                        ability
                        to detect early stage lung cancer through breathing alone. My advice to you all is to first take
                        a deep
                        breath. Look around, and know that your time at Cornell will be short, but as rewarding as you
                        make it
                        to be. This applies to everyone (even you engineers out there): write little notes about your
                        day.
                        Anything that stands out, that evokes some sort of feeling, that made you laugh or cry or even
                        get
                        angry… sometime down the line you’ll want to remember it all and see how far you’ve come.Also,
                        Thursday
                        evening is chicken tendie night at Okenshield’s.

                        Yours in LFS, Michael</p>

                    <p> What is your favorite memory from APO?
                        Having littles!

                        If you could attend one event again, what event would it be and what would you do during the
                        event?
                        I would go to Bake Challah, and I would sample all of the chocolate chips!

                        How does APO still impact your life?
                        I get to tell people I’m a frat bro! And I made lifelong friends.

                        What advice would you give current members?
                        Complete as many of the 161 Things to do at Cornell as you can!

                        What do you currently do?

                    <p>I don’t have any one standout memory, but the ones that make me smile the most are the
                        ones related
                        to
                        the
                        Family Wars. Sure, sometimes the fierceness of the competitions got a little bit out of
                        hand (we
                        worked
                        to
                        reel them in over the years!) but the camaraderie and teamwork of the families racing
                        around campus
                        at
                        night
                        was a really special feeling. Family standings are temporary, memories are forever.

                        I find myself thinking a lot about Loaves and Fishes recently. With my class schedule
                        manipulation,
                        most
                        Friday mornings I could walk down East Buffalo and dedicate 2-3 hours to prepping,
                        serving, cleaning
                        or
                        otherwise helping a regular group of Townies. I really enjoyed the manual labor and
                        being of literal
                        service
                        to that community, and the weekly dedication lifted me out of my sheltered bubble on the
                        hill for
                        much-needed perspective.

                        Your time in APO is what you make of it! Meeting the minimum requirements every semester
                        will be a
                        very
                        different experience from intentionally seeking opportunities for experiences with
                        people you like.
                        Life
                        (and college) is too short to do things you don’t want to do — APO is best with
                        intention and joy.

                    <h4>Amrit Hingorani '20</h4>
                    <p>I joined APO originally because I had heard about it from
                        friends and was interested in continuing
                        being
                        involved in community service like I was back home in Brooklyn. I’m so glad I got
                        involved looking
                        back
                        at
                        the friends I made and the events I was able to go to. My favorite service event was
                        definitely
                        Loaves
                        and
                        Fishes. I always loved being able to interact with members of the Ithaca community
                        who
                        were not in
                        any
                        way
                        affiliated with Cornell and hear about their life stories and interests. One time I
                        even
                        met a guy
                        who
                        used
                        to throw illegal hundred-person ragers in mansions all over upstate NY (don’t try
                        this
                        at home
                        y’all).
                        Fellowships were the best part of APO in my eyes because I was able to meet so many
                        other brothers
                        and
                        do a
                        lot of fun activities! I really miss tag in the stacks (rip risk management tho) and
                        light up
                        frisbee! I
                        also have fond memories of our assassin game. It was probably the most stressful
                        week of
                        Cornell but
                        definitely one of the most fun as well as everyone spent the entire week running all
                        over campus
                        like
                        chickens with no heads.
                        Advice(s) – I would say go to as many random, interesting, and unique events as
                        possible! I found
                        that
                        some
                        of the weirdest events ended up being my favorite when I look back on my time in
                        APO.
                        Also, at every
                        event,
                        try to talk to someone new! It can be easy to stick within the group of people you
                        already know and
                        feel
                        comfortable with, but we have such a big brotherhood that by not making an effort to
                        meet new
                        people,
                        you
                        might miss some really cool individuals you wouldn’t cross paths with otherwise! I
                        met
                        some of my
                        closest
                        friends in strange ways through APO, sometimes just by a chance encounter that
                        blossomed
                        into a
                        long-lasting
                        friendship. You never know when you might come across your new best friend 😉
                        Sending good vibes,

                        Amrit 🙂</p>

                    <h4>Edison Lei '20</h4>
                    <p>If I could redo college, I would join APO during my freshman fall instead of my
                        sophomore fall
                        because I
                        had
                        missed out on one more year with the APO community. Despite having hundreds of
                        members, APO’s many
                        brothers
                        welcomed me with such positivity and radiance that I truly felt I had belonged
                        somewhere. My lin,
                        notably,
                        was pleasant and fun to be with. We would constantly be reaching out to each
                        other over a group chat
                        for
                        events that we might want to participate in together like Prisoner Express and
                        Collegetown Cleanup
                        or to
                        hang out in lunch fellowships and family dinners. My big, Sarah, especially
                        inspired me to continue
                        to
                        ensure that people feel as they belong and that APO can be their haven.
                        Reflecting back, I have
                        never
                        felt
                        so grateful for how the organization has blessed me with the best littles and
                        friends that I still
                        maintain
                        contact with, for example, in Among Us. For the new members, I hope that they
                        know that we brothers
                        cherish
                        them for being themselves and APO can be a step forward to explore new service
                        adventures or to
                        learn
                        more
                        about your own interests, whether it be in service, leadership or friendship.

                    <h4>Tracy Goldman '20</h4>
                    <p>I originally joined APO looking for a community. I knew I liked community
                        service, but I wanted to
                        meet
                        new
                        people. All of my expectations of just finding a community and cool people,
                        however, was blown out
                        of
                        the
                        park. I met some of the most extraordinary and inspirational peers, I made
                        some of my best friends,
                        and
                        I
                        found a home away from home I hadn’t previously found at Cornell.

                        My advice is to take risks and try new things. Even if it’s difficult in a
                        virtual environment, go
                        out
                        of
                        your comfort zone and take solace in this incredible community. Attend
                        events with people you don’t
                        know!
                        Host a leadership event on something you know; it may even come up in a
                        final round interview for
                        the
                        full-time job you accept ;). Reaching out to people and maintaining a
                        community is especially
                        important
                        right now, and I know it’s deflating to go on Zoom so many times, but it’s
                        worth it for the
                        multitude of
                        wonderful experiences and fun APO can provide. </p>

# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts are normal and to be expected. It's best to develop a plan for handling conflicts before they arise.

**This contract is a _living_ document.** If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

## Contract

Your team contract should probably include these elements. Feel free to remove or add other terms, too.

1. To what goals do we all commit?

   - Do everything ahead of time or on time. We will start each milestone on Sunday night and plan to get it done by Tuesday. We'll look over it Wednesday and then submit it.
   - Being respectful towards each other.
   - Communicate any changes you make to the files

2. What are our "ground rules"? (Don't make an exhaustive listâ€”stick with just a few.)

   **Tip:** Interrupting another person can make them feel like their option isn't valued. Consider a rule about interrupting.

   - At least one person should try to go to office hours concerning the project
   - Do your part, but if you are really struggling (or having an emergency) communicate with the group early on
   - When coding, meet in person during the day time. When doing extra coding or design journey, can meet on zoom/facetime.
   - Be mindful of what you say and when you say it

3. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?

   - Start each milestone on Sunday night (or maybe earlier if you want) and get it done by Tuesday.
   - Don't prefer to meet Wednesdays, but anyone can feel free to look over it.
   - Amy submits it
   - Saturdays 12-2pm (somewhere on Central), Mondays 5:30-6:30pm, Tuesdays 4:30pm-5:30pm

4. How will we communicate and work with our client?

   - Amy could reach out to Jason and we would meet on Saturdays/Sundays in late afternoons via zoom/ in person
   - If its something minor, we could reach out digitally

5. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for. (**No "coder" or "designer" roles are permitted;** everyone must design and code.)

   **Tip:** It's often helpful to think of **responsibilities** rather than roles here.

   - One possible role is having someone who reminds when we are meeting (Jazz)
   - Another role is having one or two people who go to office hours to ask questions that all group members may have (Maaya and Tiffany)
   - One role is having someone type and send out action items for all the members (Tiffany)
   - Another role is proof-checking the design journey to make sure there is no spelling mistakes or anything of that nature (Amy)

6. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

   Have a face-to-face meeting being transparent, but respectful when confronting a member.

7. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?

   The best approach is to respectfully disagree, and to not needlessly debate. We should also understand that everything we are saying is to make the project better and improve upon what we already have.

8. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?

   If we feel like our old contract is not working and there are lots of disagreements and conflicts, we should have an in-person meeting where we discuss improving the old contract. If we feel that the contract is still not working, we can bring in a third party to help mediate the discussions about the contract.

9. What else do we want to include in this contract? Maybe you team needs a _fun_ clause...

   **Tip:** Not everything in life is about work. Sometimes it is important to celebrate too. Consider grabbing a coffee or ice cream at the completion of your project to celebrate!

   We could grab dinner together after the meeting on Monday from 5:30-6:30.

What else belongs in your team's contract?

Don't make anyone make inferior, everyone's idea is valuable and respected.

## Using your Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. **If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract.** If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your conflict using the contract, please email the instructors at <info1300-prof@cornell.edu>. Please be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?" You must attempt to resolve your conflicts on your own first before an instructor will intervene.

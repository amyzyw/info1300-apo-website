# Welcome to Cornell University's largest on-campus service organization
Established on December 16, 1925 at Lafayette College, Alpha Phi Omega is a co-ed service fraternity founded on the principles of Leadership, Friendship and Service. Over the years it has become the largest collegiate service organization in the world, with more than 400,000 members on over 600 campuses.

The Cornell University chapter of Alpha Phi Omega was chartered on February 17, 1927. Our chapter is the longest continually running chapter of the Alpha Phi Omega national service fraternity, where we strive to exemplify the ideals of leadership, friendship, and service far above Cayuga‚Äôs waters. Our original charter lists 17 members; today we have become one of Cornell‚Äôs largest student organizations.

# Our Pillars
## Leadership
Members can develop their own personal skills and more about chapter operations by hosting events or becoming part of our executive board.
## Friendship
Alpha Phi Omega seeks to develop friendship and all members to develop a sense of brotherhood by shared experiences through understanding the fraternal history and goals of creating community.
## Service
The chapter service program provides opportunities to develop social awareness, friendships and leadership skills.

### Michael Cirelli '20

No one can capture my time in APO better than Vin Diesel in Fast and Furious 7: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have friends‚Ä¶ I got family.‚Äù I learned so much from people of all majors and favorite CTB orders about how to work effectively with others in meaningful service; and though we rarely drive cars off skyscrapers or yeet giant safes through the streets of Rio together, I‚Äôm still close with my Cult lineage, Jenkins Clan, and APO brothers. Being scattered across the country means you‚Äôll always have family wherever you go!

In the meantime, I‚Äôm currently baking, reading, running, working out, and striving to achieve red member status at Chick-Fil-A. Besides that, I‚Äôm spending my gap years before medical school as a clinical research coordinator in thoracic surgery; my main research project involves testing a handheld device‚Äôs ability to detect early stage lung cancer through breathing alone.

My advice to you all is to first take a deep breath. Look around, and know that your time at Cornell will be short, but as rewarding as you make it to be. This applies to everyone (even you engineers out there): write little notes about your day. Anything that stands out, that evokes some sort of feeling, that made you laugh or cry or even get angry‚Ä¶ sometime down the line you‚Äôll want to remember it all and see how far you‚Äôve come. Also, Thursday evening is chicken tendie night at Okenshield‚Äôs.

Yours in LFS, Michael

### Logan Noonan '13

Complete as many of the 161 Things to do at Cornell as you can!

What do you currently do?
Program Management for Humanitarian and Development Aid

### Bethany Angeliu '18
I don‚Äôt have any one standout memory, but the ones that make me smile the most are the ones related to the Family Wars. Sure, sometimes the fierceness of the competitions got a little bit out of hand (we worked to reel them in over the years!) but the camaraderie and teamwork of the families racing around campus at night was a really special feeling. Family standings are temporary, memories are forever.

I find myself thinking a lot about Loaves and Fishes recently. With my class schedule manipulation, most Friday mornings I could walk down East Buffalo and dedicate 2-3 hours to prepping, serving, cleaning or otherwise helping a regular group of Townies. I really enjoyed the manual labor and being of literal service to that community, and the weekly dedication lifted me out of my sheltered bubble on the hill for much-needed perspective.

Your time in APO is what you make of it! Meeting the minimum requirements every semester will be a very different experience from intentionally seeking opportunities for experiences with people you like. Life (and college) is too short to do things you don‚Äôt want to do ‚Äî APO is best with intention and joy.

### Amrit Hingorani '20
I joined APO originally because I had heard about it from friends and was interested in continuing being involved in community service like I was back home in Brooklyn. I‚Äôm so glad I got involved looking back at the friends I made and the events I was able to go to. My favorite service event was definitely Loaves and Fishes. I always loved being able to interact with members of the Ithaca community who were not in any way affiliated with Cornell and hear about their life stories and interests. One time I even met a guy who used to throw illegal hundred-person ragers in mansions all over upstate NY (don‚Äôt try this at home y‚Äôall). Fellowships were the best part of APO in my eyes because I was able to meet so many other brothers and do a lot of fun activities! I really miss tag in the stacks (rip risk management tho) and light up frisbee! I also have fond memories of our assassin game. It was probably the most stressful week of Cornell but definitely one of the most fun as well as everyone spent the entire week running all over campus like chickens with no heads.

Advice(s) ‚Äì I would say go to as many random, interesting, and unique events as possible! I found that some of the weirdest events ended up being my favorite when I look back on my time in APO. Also, at every event, try to talk to someone new! It can be easy to stick within the group of people you already know and feel comfortable with, but we have such a big brotherhood that by not making an effort to meet new people, you might miss some really cool individuals you wouldn‚Äôt cross paths with otherwise! I met some of my closest friends in strange ways through APO, sometimes just by a chance encounter that blossomed into a long-lasting friendship. You never know when you might come across your new best friend üòâ


Sending good vibes,

Amrit üôÇ

### Edison Lei '20
If I could redo college, I would join APO during my freshman fall instead of my sophomore fall because I had missed out on one more year with the APO community. Despite having hundreds of members,  APO‚Äôs many brothers welcomed me with such positivity and radiance that I truly felt I had belonged somewhere. My lin, notably, was pleasant and fun to be with. We would constantly be reaching out to each other over a group chat for events that we might want to participate in together like Prisoner Express and Collegetown Cleanup or to hang out in lunch fellowships and family dinners. My big, Sarah, especially inspired me to continue to ensure that people feel as they belong and that APO can be their haven. Reflecting back, I have never felt so grateful for how the organization has blessed me with the best littles and friends that I still maintain contact with, for example, in Among Us. For the new members, I hope that they know that we brothers cherish them for being themselves and APO can be a step forward to explore new service adventures or to learn more about your own interests, whether it be in service, leadership or friendship.

### Tracy Goldman '20
I originally joined APO looking for a community. I knew I liked community service, but I wanted to meet new people. All of my expectations of just finding a community and cool people, however, was blown out of the park. I met some of the most extraordinary and inspirational peers, I made some of my best friends, and I found a home away from home I hadn‚Äôt previously found at Cornell.

My advice is to take risks and try new things. Even if it‚Äôs difficult in a virtual environment, go out of your comfort zone and take solace in this incredible community. Attend events with people you don‚Äôt know! Host a leadership event on something you know; it may even come up in a final round interview for the full-time job you accept ;). Reaching out to people and maintaining a community is especially important right now, and I know it‚Äôs deflating to go on Zoom so many times, but it‚Äôs worth it for the multitude of wonderful experiences and fun APO can provide.

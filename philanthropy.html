        <p>Nate, sadly, passed away in 2011, but Gamma wanted to honor his memory. The Nathaniel Rand Playroom Program provides funding for Playroom Assistants for inpatient units. Nate was a dedicated Child Life volunteer at The Children’s Hospital at Montefiore (CHAM) and this program named in his memory helps children and adolescents every day.</p>
        <p>Nate spent several summers as a volunteer and loved his work with the children. He understood the fears and issues that children and teenagers face in the medical setting due to his own experiences as a hospital patient. Nate planned to dedicate his career to helping others overcome the challenges and stresses in their lives. Through the Nathaniel Rand Playroom Program, Nate’s mission is continued.</p>

                        This 5K race, was created in memory of Cornell student Nathaniel Rand, who tragically died in a swimming accident in the gorges in 2011. Nate was admired among his peers for his positive attitude and his ability to bring a smile to anyone’s face. All of the proceeds from Nate’s Run For Smiles benefit the Childrens’ Hospital at Montefiore, where Nate used to volunteer and spread his positivity among the patients, specifically to the Child Play Therapy Room. This is a room where children in the hospital can go and play without there being any medical terms and treatments.
